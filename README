Class-LazyFactory
=================

Class::LazyFactory is a base class for factory classes. Concrete classes
are lazy loaded, i.e. dynamically require()d, and instances of the
concrete classes are constructed. 

By using a factory method design pattern, one can provide a consistent
interface for constructing a family of classes, without knowing the actual
concrete classes in advance.
